# Covid19-Social-Distancing-Detection
 This is a Social Distancing Detector project.

# Social Distancing Detector and Monitoring Project/ COVID-19 Tracker.
This project uses Deep Learning based YOLO V3 Pretrained model for object Detection, OpenCV python library for image processing and Centroid Tracking Algorithm For object  tracking. In this project, I am attaching the code for building a Social Distancing Detector to detect if a crowd is practicing Social Distancing or not, using a sample video.

Social Distancing is one such terminology that has gained popularity over the past few months, thanks to COVID-19. People are forced to maintain a sufficient amount of distance between each other to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Amidst this crisis, Me & My Project Team decided to build a simple Social Distancing Detector that could monitor the practice of social distancing in a crowd.

## Programming languange & Algorithm used:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [YOLOv3 model](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-perform-object-detection-with-yolov3-in-keras/)

## Technology Used:
- [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (for frame/image processing)
- [Deep Learning](https://machinelearningmastery.com/what-is-deep-learning/) (Used YOLO V3 Pretrained model for object Detection-(used filter for people indentification only))
- [Centroid Tracking Algo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Track_algorithm) (For object  tracking)

## Dependencies:
- imutils==0.5.3
- numpy==1.18.5
- opencv-python==4.2.0.34
- pkg-resources==0.0.0
- scipy==1.4.1

## RESULT OF MODEL ON TESTING:
