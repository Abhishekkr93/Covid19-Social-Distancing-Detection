# Social Distancing Detector & Monitoring Project. (COVID-19_Tracker)
In this project, I am attaching the code for building a Social Distancing Detector to detect if a crowd is practicing Social Distancing or not, using a sample video.

Social Distancing is one such terminology that has gained popularity over the past few months, thanks to COVID-19. People are forced to maintain a sufficient amount of distance between each other to prevent the spread of this deadly virus. Amidst this crisis, Me & My Project Team decided to build a simple Social Distancing Detector that could monitor the practice of social distancing in a crowd.

## Technology Used:
#### OpenCV (for frame/image processing)
#### DeepLearning (Used YOLO V3 Pretrained model for object Detection-(used filter for people indentification only))
#### Centroid Tracking Algo (For object  tracking)

### This is Computer Vision And Image Processing project which can be used for monitoring social distancing in Lockdown & to fight against COVID-19 a.k.a. the Corona Virus.
