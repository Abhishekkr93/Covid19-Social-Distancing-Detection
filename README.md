## Technology Used:
#### OpenCV (for frame/image processing)
#### DeepLearning (Used YOLO V3 Pretrained model for object Detection-(used filter for people indentification only))
#### Centroid Tracking Algo (For object  tracking)

## This is important Computer Vision And Image Processing project which can be used for monitoring social distancing in Lockdown & to fight against COVID-19 a.k.a. the Corona Virus.
